	Long: `Copies a ROM file from the current machine to a remote machine where RetroPie is running.
RoSy will copy the ROM file to the correct directory in $HOME/RetroPie/roms/.
For example:

rosy cp Game.md

copies Game.md to $HOME/RetroPie/roms/genesis.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// cpCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// cpCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
